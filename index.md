  description: GOAT stands for Geo Open Accessibility Tool. This web-tool is meant to be open source, interactive, flexible and useful for accessibility planning. It is under development at the [Chair for Urban Structure and Transport Planning at TUM](https://www.bgu.tum.de/sv/startseite/). Currently, GOAT is designed to model walking and cycling accessibility and frequent enhancements are done. You can test different versions of GOAT [here](/versions).

why:
  title: Why to use GOAT?
  image: isochrone_amenities.png
  description: There is rising awareness that active mobility plays a vital role in urban transport systems. However, to the date there are few planning instruments that are focusing on walking and cycling. GOAT as an accessibility tool is therefore designed to model walking/cycling accessibility and serve as a suitable instrument for easier, better and more open transport and urban planning.

features:

  description: The main focus of GOAT is to offer dynamic accessibility analysis at the street,neighborhood and district level. With GOAT, you can calculate different accessibility indicators such as isochrones and gravity-based heatmaps. What is more special about GOAT is that you can develop your own case scenarios. For instance you can model the effects of a new bridge or new housing development on accessibility. You can view GOAT in action in the videos [here](https://www.open-accessibility.org/videos).
