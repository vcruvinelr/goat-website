We love OPEN SOURCE! It is the heart and soul of GOAT since its start. For that reason, GOAT’s architecture is completely built with open source software, anyone can contribute while the operation and functionality of GOAT is completely free. Therefore, GOAT is mainly built with OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, their geographical data is an indispensable data source for countless projects worldwide, and that is thanks to the thousands of mappers and contributors around the globe. We are keen to not only consume this data but furthermore give data back to the whole community. Therefore we are mapping locally wherever possible, when setting up GOAT in a particular study area. In this course we are very excited to announce a new way to improve the OpenStreetMap data used by GOAT right through its user interface, this feature is called OSM Mapping Mode.

With this new feature, we are introducing a way to edit OSM-data without leaving GOAT. Moreover, we are looking to focus and make it easier to improve the data required by the features of GOAT. How does it work? The topics and data required to be completed are organized as tasks. Right now, there are tasks available for completing the information about building types, the maximum speed and the quality of the surface of the streets, as well as the opening hours of points of interest. But the type and number of challenges will be updated in the future. In the images below you can see how the mapping challenges in GOAT look like. To know more about how you can contribute to the operation of GOAT through this tool please check out this [tutorial](../docs/osm_tutorial/).

You are highly welcome to test the OSM Mapping Mode in the GOAT versions of Munich, Fürstenfeldbruck and Freising and help the community closing data gaps. In Fürstenfeldbruck and Freising, we additionally created mapping challenges in a tool called MapRoulette. The system works very similarly by setting tasks related to the information that we want to improve, so far, we have set three [tasks](https://maproulette.org/browse/challenges?project=GOAT) in MapRoulette. Two for Freising and one for Fürstenfeldbruck, related to the update of opening hours of POIs (see image below).

We thank you for your interest in improving the OSM-data. OSM is the best source of the geographical information and it has been like that thanks to thousands of people that work on its collection and keeping the data up to date. Improving the information available for everybody is part of our DNA, by developing OSM Mapping Mode and using MapRoulette we are committed to improve the info available in our local context. The collected data will update directly the OSM database and will be frequently used to update the database of GOAT. With a better quality of the data available, we can enhance the operation and results of our tool.
